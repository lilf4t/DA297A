# What can a patient do?
# ----------------------
# 1. Sign up for the health center by entering their  first name, last name, gender (F, M or NB), address, phone nr, birthdate (registration date should be recorded) (can only sign up once, so patient id should be unique)
# 2. See all their info and edit the information except for Patient ID and registration date.
# 3. Book an appointment for a specific doctor. They should see a list of all doctors, their specilization and visit cost. See the available days and times for visiting the doctor and then book the appointment. (booking can only be made on a friday of the week for the coming week, should be changeable) 
# 4. View their medical record (see all diagnosis and prescription) for each previous visit.
